Game of Life: Implement in MPI platform. 
• Consider the Game of Life problem as given in the link below. • Design a Task Channel Model and develop the parallel solution.  • Implement your solution using MPI. 
• Run the program instances on some of the data sets from the link  given below 
• Comment on the efficiency of your program 
• Comment on scalability of your program

Please note:  
• The link points to a challenge where the issue is to train models. 
• We are not attempting that. We are interested in a MPI program  working efficiently which is scalable. You may need to use more than  one data set to work upon. This link would help. 
• Link is used to define the problem and for you to download data sets.
 • You may also use the link to draw ideas and inspirations
