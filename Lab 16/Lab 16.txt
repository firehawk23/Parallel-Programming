Write sequential code to perform Matrix Multiplication (square matrices) in  following two different ways: 
a. Iterative Row wise Multiplication 
b. Recursive Block wise Multiplication 
Now do the following: 
1. Record the execution time for various size of Matrix. 
2. Report a qualitative comparison of the two methods based on the  performance of your codes. 
3. What can be concluded regarding the relationship of memory size and execution time, across the memory hierarchy? 
4. List the learnings from this work.
