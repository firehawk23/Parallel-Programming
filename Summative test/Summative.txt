A prime number is a positive integer evenly divisible by exactly two positive 
integers: itself and 1. The first five prime numbers are 2, 3, 5,7, and 11. 
Sometimes two consecutive odd numbers are both prime.
For example, the odd integers following 3, 5, and 11 are all prime numbers.
However, the odd integer following 7 is not a prime number. 
So, the list of pairs of consecutive odd integers both prime within the range 0..15 
is [(3,5), (5,7), (11,13)].
Notation: In the above example, N=15, K=3.
Exercise:
Write a parallel program to determine, for all integers Iess than N(a large 
integer) the number of times(K) that two consecutive odd integers are both 
prime.
a. Check your program for correctness, for N=50. 
b. Report K for N=10,000 and N=1,000,000. 
c. List all the K pairs for the above two values of N.
d. Record the execution time for the above two cases
e. Conclusions
